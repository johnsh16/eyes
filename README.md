# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes
<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>
## This project was created as an assignment for the MIT x-Pro Certificate in Full Stack Development. 
## The project is an example of tracking user input, in this case the cursor, in order to update the DOM in real time. This is a skill I would like to build on to create increasingly complex user interactions within the DOM. 
## Planned improvements:
### -create a mouth
### -make things for the eyes to look at
## HOW TO RUN:
### -Download all files onto your computer. Drag the file called 'eyes.html' into your browser. Enjoy!
